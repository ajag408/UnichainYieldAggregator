# Uniswap V4 Yield Optimizer

A yield optimization protocol built on Uniswap V4's hook system that provides automated yield tracking, dynamic rebalancing, and gas-optimized swapping mechanisms.

## Overview

This project implements a custom Uniswap V4 hook([1](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview)) that:

- Tracks yields across liquidity pools
- Automatically rebalances positions based on yield differentials
- Implements a novel gas-optimized swapping mechanism
- Utilizes Uniswap V4's singleton architecture and flash accounting

## Key Features

### Uniswap V4 Integration

- Uses V4's singleton architecture for efficient pool management
- Implements hook callbacks for lifecycle events
- Utilizes flash accounting for gas optimization
- Supports native ETH operations

### Yield Optimization

- Automated yield tracking across pools
- Dynamic rebalancing based on yield differentials
- Gas-efficient position management
- Custom swap routing for optimal execution
